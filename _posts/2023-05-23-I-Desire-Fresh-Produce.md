My household likes produce.  A significant portion of the food budget goes to things like lettuce, strawberries, tomatoes, basil, etc, all from the grocery store.  While I love shopping as much as
the next person, I don't always want to run to the store in the middle of my day to spend too much money on _way_ too much mint.  What am I going to do with the rest of this mint?  How many mojitos do
these packaging companies thing I can drink?  Not to mention the obvious quality and availablity issues, especially out of season, a solution is in order.

Now, I could just start a nice little garden like a normal person, but history has (repeatedly) proven that I am incapable of taking care of plants on a regular basis.  Additionally, my tiny, poorly-lit apartment
has proven to produce negligible yield in past horticultural attempts.  No, I need something that I can cram into a dark corner of my apartment and more-or-less forget about until the exact moment that I require some
basil for my pizza.

# The Plan
A PVC tower garden, similar to [this one](https://extension.okstate.edu/fact-sheets/building-a-vertical-hydroponic-tower.html), but modified to fit into a corner on roughly 16" x 16" of floor space (a measure derived
loosely from the IKEA Kallax shelves that function as the cornerstone of my interior design strategy).  Total height should be not more than 8 feet or so.  The garden should feature a primary reservoir in the circulation
loop with a pump to feed/water the plants in the tower.  The garden should also have secondary reservoirs for solutions to raise pH, lower pH, raise dissolved mineral concentration (nutrient solution), as well as
potentially a container for fresh water.  Alternatively, water could just be added by the meatware on a notification system.  Each reservoir should be easily refillable.

The goal is for the system to be heavily automated - watering and lighting should be controlled on a timer, and the primary reservoir should be monitored for water level, pH, and dissolved mineral concentration.
The system should attempt to correct the parameters that it can, and notify the user of any uncorrectable issues, including detectable problems with the electronics themselves.  Control system redundancy is desirable,
but not required - maybe run single-string for the first draft then go from there.
