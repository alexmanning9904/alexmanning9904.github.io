I eventually wanted to run this setup on a custom controller to make sure that packaging is nice and clean while I work software.  While I eventually would like this thing to have a high level of hardware redundancy, I think it's best to descope that for now.  At this moment, I'm shooting for the following interfaces:
 - Power:
   - 120VAC mains power input (unpopulated)
   - 24VDC power input
   -
