# About Me

I work with embedded software and hardware.  Outside work, I tinker with FPGA development, watches, stock trading algorithms, strange video game controllers, and food.  I also help kids get excited about engineering through FIRST Robotics.  This is a place for me to dump information about my projects, maybe even in a coherent manner.
